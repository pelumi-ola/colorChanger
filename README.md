## Implementation Details

### HTML
- Uses a proper HTML5 document structure.
- Includes a container with:
  - A heading (`h1`) titled **Color Changer**
  - A `div` element with the id `color-box`
  - A button with the id `change-color-btn`
- Links external CSS and JavaScript files.

### CSS
- Uses Flexbox to center content on the page.
- Styles the color box with fixed dimensions and a default background color.
- Styles the button to make it visually appealing and easy to interact with.

### JavaScript
- Waits for the DOM to load using the `DOMContentLoaded` event.
- Selects elements using `document.getElementById()`.
- Implements a `getRandomColor()` function that generates random hexadecimal color values.
- Changes the background color of the box when the button is clicked.
- Logs the new color to the browser console each time it changes.
